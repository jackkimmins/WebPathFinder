# Traveling Salesman Problem Solver Using a Genetic Algorithm in C++ WebAssembly
This project is a C++ WebAssembly (WASM) implementation of a solver for the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) using a genetic algorithm. The solver is designed to find an approximate solution to the TSP, which involves finding the shortest possible route that visits a list of cities and returns to the origin city. The project showcases how complex algorithms can be efficiently implemented and executed in a web environment using WebAssembly.

The TSP is a well-known combinatorial optimisation problem. It poses a significant challenge due to its NP-hard nature, meaning that no known algorithm can solve all instances of the problem quickly (in polynomial time).
